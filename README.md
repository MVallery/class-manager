# Class Manager 
Class Manager is an app made for teachers to track student behavior data and allow them to create seating charts at the same time. Students can be moved around, and can be displayed in rows and groups of various sizes. 

Node, Express, and MongoDB was used to build user authentication which allows users to save their student data and class seating arrangement.

# Motivation
While working as a teacher I often used an application called class dojo to track student behavior. There were many features I wish the application had to make it more useful such as a way to actually arrange students in a seating chart, or be able to give points and switch classes more easily. With class manager I aimed to create an application that would incorporate all these features into one. 

# Features
* Create a class of students by inputting a class name, and a comma separated list of students to add to your class.
* Customize your seating arrangement by choosing between groups or rows and changing the color and size of the student icons.

* Randomly shuffle your entire class in order to generate new seating arrangements, or drag students around individually to have more control.
* Easily add or remove students from the class as needed.
* Select individual or multiple students to add or remove points based on behavior.

* Select a random student to call on.
* Student icons temporarily glow red or green based on whether the point added was positive or negative to give visual feedback to the teacher.
